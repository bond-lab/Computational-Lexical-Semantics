\myslide{Effective Research}
\MyLogo{Advice from my group leader at NTT: the late Dr Ikehara}

\begin{itemize}
\item Write early --- writing clarifies your thoughts
\item Become an authority on your topic --- start narrow and broaden
  \\ you want to be the person people cite/invite 
\item Work on two strands --- one can move forward when the other stops
  \\ but don't spread yourself too thin
\end{itemize}

\myslide{You and your research}
\MyLogo{Richard Hamming: \textbf{read it}}

\begin{itemize}
\item \emp{What are the important problems of your field?}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Are you working on them? If not, why not?
  \item  Do important work rather than trivial work
  \end{itemize}
\item Talk to interesting people --- keep your door open
\item Sell your research (50\%) --- if it is not published/released it doesn't exist
\item Choose which battles to fight (and which not to)
\item Act respectfully to everyone (superior or inferior)
\item Work harder --- it's cumulative
\end{itemize}


\myslide{Authorship}

``IEEE affirms that authorship credit must be reserved for individuals
who have met each of the following conditions:

\begin{enumerate}\addtolength{\itemsep}{-2ex}
\item  Made a significant intellectual contribution to the theoretical development, system or experimental design, prototype development, and/or the analysis and interpretation of data associated with the work contained in the manuscript;
\item    Contributed to drafting the article or reviewing and/or revising it for intellectual content;
\item     Approved the final version of the manuscript as accepted for publication, including references.'' 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}\addtolength{\itemsep}{-1ex}
\item Discuss authorship early; be generous; don't worry about the order so much
\item Cite widely (generally 25\% of a good paper; less then 25\% in-group)
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Open Research and Reproducibility}

\begin{itemize}
\item You should test your ideas against the state-of-the-art
\item If you are the state-of-the-art you should make it easy for
  other people to compare
  \begin{itemize}
  \item release test-data
  \item release systems
  \item preferably with a script to reproduce the exact results
  \end{itemize}
\item Papers with data get cited more --- they move the field forwards
\item Choose/construct data-sets you can release
\end{itemize}
